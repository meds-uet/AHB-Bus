The AMBA Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) is a bus protocol introduced by ARM ltd. for on-chip communication between components such as microprocessors, memory interfaces, and peripherals. AHB is a high-performance bus protocol and is the de facto standard for on-chip communication in the majority of modern digital design systems. The AHB protocol is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave bus protocol which can operate at a maximum frequency of 1 GHz.

## Components of AHB
- **Arbiter**: Manages access to the bus, ensuring that only one master can use the bus at a time.
- **Master**: Initiates read and write operations by providing address and control signals.
- **Slave**: Responds to master requests, providing data for read operations or receiving data for write operations.
- **Decoder**: Determines which slave the master intends to communicate with, based on the address provided.
- **Bus**: The physical interconnect that carries data, address, and control signals between components.
- **Master to Slave Multiplexer (MSMUX)**: A multiplexer that selects the master that is currently accessing the bus.
- **Slave to Master Multiplexer (SMMUX)**: A multiplexer that selects the slave that is currently being accessed by the master.



## üîë Main Features of AHB Bus Protocol
The AHB Protocol Features that are supported are given as follow :


### ‚úÖ 1. Single Clock Edge Operation
- All operations are synchronized to the **rising edge** of a single system clock.
- Simplifies timing analysis and enhances performance.

---

### üöÄ 2. Burst Transfers
- Supports **burst types**: `SINGLE`, `INCR`, `WRAP4`, `INCR4`, `INCR8`, `INCR16`, etc.
- Improves efficiency by reducing address/control overhead during sequential data transfers.

---

### üîÅ 3. Pipelined Operation
- AHB supports pipelining with separate **address phase** and **data phase**.
- Enables a new transfer to begin before the previous one completes.
- Improves throughput significantly.

---

### üì• 4. Multi-Master Support
- Supports multiple bus masters like CPU, DMA, etc.
- Masters use an **arbitration mechanism** (external to AHB) to gain control of the bus.
- Only one master can drive the bus at any time.

---

### üîÄ 5. Address and Data Bus Multiplexing
- AHB uses shared lines for address and data (i.e., bus multiplexing).
- Reduces the number of physical signals/pins.

---

### üì¶ 6. 32-bit or 64-bit Data Bus
- Data bus is typically **32-bit wide**, but can also be extended to **64 bits** or more for higher performance.

---

### ‚ùó 7. Error Reporting via HRESP
- The `HRESP` signal returns response status:
  - `OKAY` ‚Äì Normal transfer
  - `ERROR` ‚Äì Error occurred

---

### üß† 8. External Arbitration Logic
- Arbitration between masters is handled **outside** the AHB bus.
- Common schemes: fixed-priority, round-robin, or custom.

---

### üì∂ 9. Transfer Types
- **IDLE** ‚Äì No transfer
- **BUSY** ‚Äì Pipeline stall (no address phase)
- **NONSEQ** ‚Äì Start of a new transfer or burst
- **SEQ** ‚Äì Sequential transfer within a burst

---

### üéØ 10. Handshaking Between Master and Slave
- `HREADY` and `HRESP` signals coordinate data transfers.
- Master waits if slave is not ready.

---

### üìã 11. Memory-Mapped Support
- AHB is designed for **memory-mapped peripheral access**.
- Each device is assigned a specific address region.

## üß† Tip
AHB sits between **APB (simple)** and **AXI (advanced)** in terms of complexity and performance.

# Component Description
This section goes over the description of each of the components used in the AHB bus protocol.

Since the main component of this protocol is **Arbiter** that controls the flow of **Data, Address** and **Control Signals** so lets start with this

## Arbiter

The Arbiter is a critical component of the AHB protocol. It is responsible for managing access to the bus, ensuring that only one master can use the bus at a time. The Arbiter is responsible for resolving conflicts between multiple masters who wish to access the bus simultaneously. It does this by implementing a bus allocation algorithm, which determines which master will be granted access to the bus for a given transaction.

The Arbiter accepts bus requests from multiple masters and grants access to the bus based on its bus allocation algorithm. It can grant access to the bus to a single master at a time, or it can grant access to multiple masters simultaneously if the bus is not busy.

The Arbiter is also responsible for handling priority of the bus requests. It can prioritize bus requests based on the requirements of the system. For example, in a system with a high priority interrupt handler, the Arbiter can grant access to the bus to the interrupt handler before any other master.


### Allocation Algorithm
The allocation algorithm used in the Arbiter is a Round Robin priority algorithm. It works as follows:

- The Arbiter keeps track of the priority of each master.

- When only a single master requests the bus, it is granted the access.

- When multiple masters request the bus at the same time, the Arbiter grants the bus to the highest priority master.

- If the highest priority master does not have a valid request, the Arbiter moves to the next highest priority master.

- If all masters have a valid request, the Arbiter grants the bus to each master in round robin order.

- If a master does not have a valid request when it is its turn, the Arbiter moves to the next highest priority master.
